Objective: Develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for a dynamic Data Health Dashboard that visually assesses the completeness, quality, and duplicates in product data. 

Be able to score the data health of vendors, identify those who provide high or poor-quality data, and understand which vendors meet each criterion.  

This POC should provide valuable insights into data health, aiding in prospect meetings and potential business growth.  

The focus is on the automotive aftermarket and heavy-duty product data, but this could be used by other industries as well. 

Deliverables:  Create a POC Mock-up of the Data Health Dashboard, including the underlying logic. It is subject to updates based on the resources shared by Pivotree, such as client data and their existing dashboard. Additionally, present our POC dashboard to the executives of Pivotree.
